# Valgrind suppression file for hash shell
# These suppressions are for intentional memory patterns, not bugs.

# The parser intentionally doesn't free output buffers to avoid use-after-free
# during alias expansion. Memory is reclaimed by OS at process exit.
# See src/parser.c parse_line() comments for details.
